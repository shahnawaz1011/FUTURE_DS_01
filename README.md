# FUTURE_DS_01 

𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁! 📊
As part of my Data Analyst internship at hashtag#FutureInterns ,
Here’s what I did step by step:

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 1: 

Data Cleaning & Transformation \
Removed invalid entries such as negative or zero quantities\
Handled missing values in key columns (Customer ID, Sales, Product Name)\
Prepared the data for analysis using Power Query\

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 2: 

Creating Core Metrics (DAX Measures)\
Created Total Sales, Total Quantity, Total Orders, and Total Customers measures\
These KPIs helped summarize the business performance\

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 3: 

Best-Selling Products Analysis\
Identified top 10 best-selling products by quantity\
Also analyzed high-revenue products with lower sales volume\

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 4: 

Sales Trend Analysis\
Built a monthly sales trend line chart\
Analyzed seasonality and peak months\

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 5: 

Created Tree Maps for revenue distribution by product\
Built Donut Charts to show revenue contribution by country\
Identified products that drive most revenue vs high-volume products\

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 6: 

Interactivity with Slicers\
Added Country, Year, and Month slicers\

📈 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 ➤
1. WHITE HANGING T-LIGHT HOLDER is the best-selling product by quantity and also contributes significantly to total revenue (High demand indicates it is a mass-market product rather than a niche item.)

2. Several products such as AMAZON FEE, Vintage Post Office Cabinet, and Vintage Kitchen Cabinets generate high revenue despite lower sales volume. This indicates premium pricing.

3. Several products generate lower sales and revenue, possibly due to limited demand or niche appeal.

4. The United Kingdom dominates total revenue, contributing the majority share of sales.

5. International orders often involve higher shipping charges and longer delivery times. This can reduce purchase frequency for non-UK customers.
