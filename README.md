As part of my Data Analyst internship at hashtag#FutureInterns , I worked on an E-commerce Sales Analysis project using Power BI, where I analyzed transactional data to uncover meaningful business insights. 

📈 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 ➤
1. WHITE HANGING T-LIGHT HOLDER is the best-selling product by quantity and also contributes significantly to total revenue (High demand indicates it is a mass-market product rather than a niche item.)

2. Several products such as AMAZON FEE, Vintage Post Office Cabinet, and Vintage Kitchen Cabinets generate high revenue despite lower sales volume. This indicates premium pricing.

3. Several products generate lower sales and revenue, possibly due to limited demand or niche appeal.

4. The United Kingdom dominates total revenue, contributing the majority share of sales.

5. International orders often involve higher shipping charges and longer delivery times. This can reduce purchase frequency for non-UK customers.
